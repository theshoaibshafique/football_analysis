The aim of this project is to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in video footage using YOLO, a top-tier AI object detection model. ⚽ We will enhance the model's performance through training. Additionally, we will classify players into teams based on their t-shirt colors using K-means for pixel segmentation and clustering. 🎽📊 This data will enable us to calculate a team's ball possession percentage during a match.

To accurately measure player movement, we will use optical flow to assess camera motion between frames and apply perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective. This allows us to convert player movement from pixels to meters. 📐 Finally, we will calculate each player's distance covered. This comprehensive project encompasses a range of concepts and tackles real-world problems, making it ideal for both novice and experienced machine learning engineers. 🚀
